    2. ACCEPTANCE: An unqualified agreement to the terms of the offer.
    3. CONSIDERATION: Something of value exchanged between the parties.
    4. CAPACITY: Legal ability of parties to enter into a contract.
    5. LEGALITY: The contract's purpose must be legal and not against public policy.

    B. Based on Performance:
